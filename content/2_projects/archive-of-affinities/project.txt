## Archive of Affinities

As exchange students under different circumstances from the ones in our respectful architecture schools, we found ourselves living a lifestyle based on consumerism. Throughout our stay, we had gathered wrappers, cans, bottles, etc; anything that we found ourselves consuming on a daily basis. Our idea was simple: with a couple of weeks left before departure, document the process of the products’ decay in time, a way to remember the unique experience in Shanghai.

It wasn’t as easy as imagined. After a couple of days, all there was left to be found was the wooden structure by the building’s rooftop trash, with all mementos of our stay gone. With less than a week left, giving it another try resulted in placing the Archive of Affinities higher up, the elevator shaft’s rooftop. 

We had found, at least, in the process of wandering around the city, more items to use to complete the installation. Gathering the remaining food from our refrigerators resulted in a new interpretation of the Archive of Affinities while still keeping the essence of consumerism.
