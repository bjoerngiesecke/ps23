## Finding Dory

Disneyland is one of the most intriguing places in this world. Meant to represent an enclave of dreams for both children and adults, it also portrays a certain craft within the architectural scene as most works demonstrate a certain sculptural charm. Finding Dory is sever- al things, but is primarily a criticism to the awaited perfection and staticity of project presentations at school. This project in concept is meant to be an iteration to a Finding Dory ride in Disneyland Shanghai.

With the same materials always recurring in school models, this project sought to prioritize craft, light and sound to provide an immersive experience for the viewers. By sculpting what would be the rideâ€™s vehicle, the process of handcraft was rediscovered.
