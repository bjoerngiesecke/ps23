## Traces of Ufer

Traces of Ufer aims to operate within the 3 axes of the Berlin loft through proposing a functional piece of sculpture. The massive spruce attempts to come in contrast with the intricacy of laser cut aluminum and milled birch. An honest proposal as an introduction to the process of machine fabrication, focusing particularly on proportions and geometry. As a result, a surface to leave valuables upon arrival along with mobile trolleys housing either silverware for dining or beverages for the living area.

Applying structure as ornament, the construction process is meant to be visually understood by exposing all elements. Supporting all four sides of the milled birch plates are a series of 4mm laser cut aluminum sheets riveted together, adding a hint of roughness through the imperfections when hammering.
