## A Moment of Trance

Videodromeâ€™s protruding arm from the television pushed us to firstly to experiment plaster with elastic materials and iterations to manipulate.

Process is just as important as the final result. We found it crucial to be able to document and follow the evolution of the material in time. Knowing how the plaster reacted and comparing its behavior with other materials then gave us a better understanding on how to manipulate the product on a bigger scale.

Lending itself once more to Videodrome, we envisioned the Device: a space for reverie to provide a moment of trance.

To result in an immersive experience, a backrest and simple structure were built.
