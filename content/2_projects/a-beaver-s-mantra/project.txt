## A Beaver’s Mantra

Does the building need fixing? Who must one reach out to to know? Is there a framework where students can be directly aware of what type of care is required for each building upon arrival to Hooke? 
Hooke is a place to experiment and speculate, many of the buildings sitting on the forest’s soil have stories and ideas that have never made it to the final build, let alone on paper. 
This document speculates a scenario specific to the Field- station in hopes to carry on a tradition for future students to relay information about the perpetual nature of an unfinished project. 
Directly engaging each generation of Hooke with the buildings that surround them will mean spending more time on the land that will nurture them for at least a year. 
Understand and feel the place you live in.
