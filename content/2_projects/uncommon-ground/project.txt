## Uncommon Ground

A 13th century cave was discovered at the basement of a residential block. We took advantage of the situation and created an event for the lack of nightlife in the small town of Segovia, where we studied. The idea was to make a site specific installation to accompany the music for the whole event along with video projections on the textured walls.

Other areas of the space were animated with LED lighting.

Uncommon Ground draws inspiration from David Cronenberg’s Videodrome television scene. An interactive installation combining image, light and reflection.

Unfortunately, we aren’t always understood by others. With great effort of insulating the space from ‘sound pollution’, the event got shut down by the police after 20min. A collective record.
