## Housing Lucy & László

Housing Lucy & László highlights the subjective beauty of an object both in process and as a result. These are the first iterations of a series of plant pots. They aim to recycle and upcycle found objects, namely those found in the studio spaces of architecture school. Housing Lucy & László’s goal is to highlights the potential of all used materials and how they can be combined together both as formwork and falsework and transformed into another functional object.
